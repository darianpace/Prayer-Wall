### 
This site was created to provide support for those that have no one to turn to while experiencing difficult times.  Sometime you just need someone to listen. Sometimes you just need to know someone is praying for you. The Prayer Wall allows you to post your concerns, needs, cries and have your concerns prayed on by others.

 The site also host a prayer chain group that anyone can join. To join the chain, you just commit to praying once a week on a set of topics that will be emailed to you at the beginning of that week. 

The site also houses music videos and sermons around some of the reoccurring prayer topics. Visitors will be about to search by topics and listen to the sermon or music video from our video page.
