## **Prayer Wall Application**


### This project is a project for the MSSA program that accomplishes the following goals:

-Goal 1: To provide a way to comfort those who are going through difficult challenges in their lives
		 but may not have family, friends, or a spiritual leader to confide in. To provide an opportunity
		 for anyone who would like to offer prayers for someone in need, the opportunity to reach millions.
		 Application will allow user to cloak their name for those that would prefer to remain anonymous.
		 Users will be able to log on from desktop or mobile devices to submit prayer request on a wall.
		 A new wall can be created for a particular prayer request or user can post on an existing prayer wall.
